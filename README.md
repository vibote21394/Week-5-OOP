Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, called a class. This also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is known as data hiding.
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. This helps simplify the interaction with the object and makes the code easier to maintain.
Inheritance: Allowing a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reusability and hierarchical relationships.
Polymorphism: The ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated in different ways depending on their data type or class, often through method overriding or overloading.
